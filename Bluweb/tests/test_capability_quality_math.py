"""Pure-function coverage for the running-average math backing the new
Phase 9 quality-tracking columns (avg_extraction_quality on both
FetchStrategyStats and URLPatternStats). Real DB-backed integration/
concurrency testing of `record_fetch_outcome`/`record_pattern_outcome`
needs Postgres (JSONB columns, `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, `SELECT ... FOR
UPDATE` are all Postgres-only) and is explicitly NOT run in this session --
see the Phase 9 final report's Concurrency/Data Integrity section for why
and what already-proven pattern this reuses instead of re-deriving one.
