"""In-process registry of running crawl tasks, keyed by crawl_job_id.

ponytail: a plain dict works because phase-2 crawls run inline in the API
process (see main.py docstring). The moment crawls run in separate worker
processes (phase 3's scheduler), cancellation needs to go through a shared
signal -- a `cancel_requested` row/flag in Postgres that the worker polls,
which CrawlJob.status="cancelling" already models -- this registry becomes
just the local fast-path for same-process cancellation.
