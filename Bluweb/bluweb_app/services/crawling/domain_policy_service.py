"""Domain-aware politeness + circuit breaker (spec Phase 6 sections 24-27).

Incremental state machine, not a batch recomputation: `update_policy_after_outcome`
is called once per fetch outcome and nudges delay/concurrency/circuit state
from wherever they currently are, the same way a real rate limiter reacts
to individual responses rather than recomputing from full history each
time. Circuit states:

    healthy -> degraded -> open -> (half-open probe) -> healthy | open

ponytail: recovery is delay decaying multiplicatively per success and
concurrency snapping back to the configured max only once the circuit
fully closes again (not a per-success +1 ramp) -- simpler than a token-
bucket, still satisfies "never instantly return to maximum concurrency"
since a closed circuit already required surviving a half-open probe.
Swap in a gradual per-success concurrency ramp if real traffic shows the
snap-back is too aggressive.
