"""Deterministic story-match scoring (spec Phase 8 section 21-22). Pure
function -- no DB, no model calls -- same convention as
app/services/monitoring/change_detection.py.

Weights are a fixed, documented, versioned ("v1") constant, not learned or
tuned against a labeled set (none exists yet -- section 21 explicitly asks
for documented, tested initial weights, not machine-learned ones).
entity_overlap gets the largest weight because it's the most specific
signal available (two documents naming the same organization and location
is far stronger evidence than similar wording); temporal_proximity is
second because the spec's own worked example (section 17: articles A/B/C
minutes apart form one story, article D a week later does not) hinges on
it being able to veto an otherwise-plausible match on its own.

Anti-generic-overlap safeguard (section Z: "police" and "arrest" appearing
in unrelated articles must not correlate them): `entity_overlap` weights a
shared PERSON-only match far below a shared ORGANIZATION/LOCATION match,
since common names and common role-nouns are exactly the collision risk
named in the spec -- without a corpus-wide entity-frequency table (out of
scope for Phase 8), down-weighting by type is the deterministic
approximation of IDF this system can afford right now.
