"""Entity resolution (spec Phase 8 sections 12/33): decide whether a
freshly extracted entity candidate is the same real-world entity as one
already in the `entities` table, a new alias of one, or a genuinely new
entity. Pure decision logic -- DB lookups (exact-name, alias, and
pg_trgm/RapidFuzz candidate fetch) happen in the repository layer and are
handed to this module as plain `ExistingEntity` rows, matching the
domain_profile_service.py convention of keeping decision logic testable
without a database.

Pipeline (section 12): exact normalization -> alias lookup -> RapidFuzz
candidate scoring -> context/type validation -> merge decision.

PERSON safety rule (section 33's own worked example: two different real
"Ravi Kumar"s must not silently become one entity): unlike ORGANIZATION/
LOCATION, an exact-name match on a PERSON is NOT enough on its own to
merge. It also requires *corroboration* -- at least one other entity
(an ORGANIZATION or LOCATION) co-occurring in the current document that
also co-occurred with the existing entity in some prior document. Two
unrelated "Ravi Kumar" mentions in unrelated contexts (different
co-occurring orgs/locations, or none at all) each get their own Entity
row; the same "Ravi Kumar" recurring in the same real-world context
(the same organization/location showing up again) correctly merges --
this is exactly the cross-source-correlation case the spec's own news
example depends on (the same public figure named across BBC/local/blog
coverage of the same story).
