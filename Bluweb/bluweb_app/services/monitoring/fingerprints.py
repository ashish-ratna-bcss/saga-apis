"""Field-level fingerprints for Phase 7 change detection, built on top of
the existing dedup primitives (app/services/deduplication/dedup.py) which
stay untouched -- those remain crawl_engine's own exact/normalized-hash and
simhash building blocks. This module adds the finer-grained fingerprints
the change detector needs (title/metadata/structure) using the same
sha256-over-normalized-text approach, plus SimHash distance calibration.

Fingerprint usage map (spec Phase 7 section 7):
  exact equality        -> content_hash (existing exact_hash, on raw bytes)
  normalized equality    -> normalized_hash (existing, on extracted body text)
  near-duplicate/change  -> simhash + Hamming distance (this module)
  field-level change     -> title_hash / metadata_hash (this module), used
                             as cheap short-circuits before the more
                             expensive paragraph diff (text_diff.py)
