  # Web Intelligence Collection Backend

Self-hosted backend for pre-flight capability assessment, instant crawling,
and continuous monitoring of public web sources (news, forums, blogs,
classifieds, discussion boards, indexes, paginated and JS-heavy public sites).

## Status: Final completion pass (production capability boundary defined)

- Phases 1–9: previously implemented and fixture-verified.
- **Final completion pass**: closed material gaps below. **270 unit/fixture
  tests passing.** Live Docker/Postgres/MinIO/concurrency verification is
  **NOT VERIFIED** in this pass (host-local services prohibited).

## Final Engineering Report

### 1. Architecture audit (summary)

```
API → preflight → security → discovery → frontier (Crawlee)
  → fetch (HTTP|browser) → render → classification → extraction
  → quality/completeness → provenance → dedup → change detection
  → versioning → storage (Postgres+MinIO) → monitoring → learning → metrics
```

| Stage | Status |
|---|---|
| API / preflight / security / discovery / frontier | IMPLEMENTED |
| HTTP + Playwright fetch / adaptive escalation | IMPLEMENTED |
| Classification / News/Blog/Forum/Listing/Index/Generic | IMPLEMENTED |
| Quality / completeness / provenance | IMPLEMENTED |
| Dedup / change detection / monitoring | IMPLEMENTED |
| Domain + URL-pattern learning (incl. quality/browser compare) | IMPLEMENTED |
| Infinite scroll / offset pagination / lists / grouped tables | IMPLEMENTED |
| Live Docker / alembic against real Postgres / multi-host load | NOT VERIFIED |

### 2–3. Gaps closed in this pass

| Gap | Change |
|---|---|
| A JS-heavy detection | Multi-signal score (SPA roots, hydration, frameworks, external bundles, quality, domain prior) |
| B Browser escalation | Quality compare + learning labels `browser_superior`/`http_superior`/`equivalent` |
| C Rendered DOM | `domcontentloaded` + bounded networkidle, open-shadow inline, optional scroll |
| D Infinite scroll | Bounded scroll/load-more (`ScrollBudget`) |
| E Offset/start pagination | Evidence-backed next-value inference |
| F Index → frontier | `NEWS_INDEX`/`FORUM_INDEX` in `INDEX_TYPES`; chrome exclusion; SSRF at enqueue |
| G Meaningful lists | `list_extractor.py` (nav rejected) |
| H Grouped table headers | colspan/rowspan merge; Wikipedia fixture aligns |
| O Provenance | tables / lists / index_items / completeness |
| Q/R Learning loop | quality, completeness, browser-compare, index children feed routing |
| AA Crawl budgets | `max_browser_pages`, `max_discovered_urls`, `max_pagination_pages`, `max_scrolls`, … |
| Y SSRF enqueue | `_safe_enqueue` validates every discovered URL before frontier add |
| AD Events | `PREFLIGHT_COMPLETED`, `FETCH_STRATEGY_SELECTED`, `INFINITE_SCROLL_DETECTED`, `PAGE_CLASSIFIED`, … |

### 4–7. Files / DB / API

**Key files changed/added:** `javascript.py`, `pagination.py`, `table_extractor.py`, `list_extractor.py`, `browser_scroll.py`, `fetchers.py`, `crawl_engine.py`, `domain_profile_service.py`, `page_classifier.py`, `extraction_router.py`, `provenance.py`, `generic_extractor.py`, `index_extractor.py`, `listing_extractor.py`, `config.py`, `crawl.py` models, `crawl_repository.py`, `domains.py` API/schemas, `metrics.py`, migration `0012_final_browser_completeness_learning.py`, tests.

**Database:** migration `0012` adds browser-compare + completeness counters on `fetch_strategy_stats` / `url_pattern_stats`. **NOT VERIFIED** against live Postgres (`alembic check` not run — host DB prohibited).

**API:** `GET /domains/{domain}/capabilities` now includes `browser`, completeness, browser-superior rate, and explicit `score_semantics`. Preflight capability includes `score_semantics`.

### 8–22. Extraction / dynamic / discovery / quality

- Trafilatura remains primary article body extractor; Scrapling remains adaptive DOM fallback.
- Index children still enter the frontier (SSRF + dedup + budgets).
- Quality ≠ completeness preserved; both scored and (where configured) learned.
- Provenance remains JSONB under `extracted_metadata["provenance"]`.

### 23–28. Dedup / change / monitoring / learning / security / politeness

Unchanged core behavior preserved. Learning now uses quality-compare history for routing. Discovered URLs SSRF-validated at enqueue **and** at fetch. Politeness delay + circuit breaker unchanged; `recommended_concurrency` still advisory (not worker-pool sizing).

### 29–35. Observability / tests / live / performance / concurrency / docker

| Claim | Status |
|---|---|
| Unit/fixture tests | **270 passed** — UNIT TESTED / FIXTURE VERIFIED |
| Real-world live crawl validation this pass | **NOT VERIFIED** (host network/services prohibited) |
| Performance benches | Existing `pytest-benchmark` tests still run — no new scale claims |
| Concurrent learning / version races | **NOT VERIFIED** (needs Postgres) |
| Docker compose / health | **NOT VERIFIED** |

### 36. Known limitations (production boundary)

1. Browser TCP is not DNS-pinned (rebinding race residual) — DOCUMENTED.
2. Substantial SSR+SEO fallback text can still under-trigger JS heuristic without a render compare — residual.
3. Closed shadow DOM is not pierced (open shadow only).
4. Infinite scroll is bounded and heuristic; sites needing complex UI interaction are out of scope.
5. Offset inference never invents page size without URL/DOM evidence.
6. No API auth; in-process scheduler only; no Redis/Kafka/OpenSearch/LLM.
7. SimHash stored but not used for corpus-wide near-dup clustering.
8. Migrations `0011`/`0012` application against production Postgres: operator responsibility.

### 37. Deferred technologies

RAG, LLM extraction, embeddings, vector DB, AI classification, Kafka, Temporal, Kubernetes, Redis, OpenSearch — **DEFERRED** (no demonstrated requirement).

### 39. Production-readiness assessment

**Ready for controlled production use** on public HTTP(S) sources with operator-applied migrations, configured crawl budgets, and acceptance of documented residuals (browser DNS pin, in-process scheduler, no auth).

**Not ready to claim:** universal web coverage, multi-region scale, or live verification of this completion pass against production infra.

### 40. Recommended future work

1. Postgres testcontainers + `alembic check` in CI.
2. DNS-pinning proxy for Playwright.
3. Optional robots `Crawl-Delay` / per-URL robots.
4. Apply `recommended_concurrency` to the worker pool.
5. Corpus-wide SimHash clustering (if needed).
6. Authn/authz on the API.

## Earlier phases (1–9)

Historical phase notes remain below for context. Where they conflict with
this final report (e.g. HN index gap, grouped table headers, JS external
bundles, Phase 4 “complete” banner), **this final report wins**.

## Status: Phase 4 of 4 (historical)

- **Phase 1 — Foundation + Pre-flight**: complete.
- **Phase 2 — Instant Crawl**: complete.
- **Phase 3 — Monitoring + Search**: complete.
- **Phase 4 — Observability + Hardening**: complete.

All four phases are built and manually verified end-to-end against real
Postgres, MinIO, and network targets. See "Known limitations" below for
what's honestly still missing (this is a working backend, not a finished
product — no auth, no distributed workers, no OpenSearch).

### Phase 1 — Foundation + Pre-flight

- `URLSecurityService`: SSRF protection (scheme allowlist, private/loopback/
  link-local/reserved/multicast IP blocking, DNS-pinned HTTP transport that
  re-validates every redirect hop)
- Full pre-flight pipeline: DNS → HTTP/TLS/redirects → robots.txt → sitemap →
  RSS/Atom feeds → HTML analysis → JS-dependency heuristic → bounded page
  sampling → Trafilatura extraction test → Playwright browser fallback →
  weighted capability score
- `POST /api/v1/preflight`, `GET /api/v1/preflight/{id}`, health/readiness

### Phase 2 — Instant Crawl

- Crawlee's `RequestQueue` as the bounded URL frontier (durable on-disk
  queue, dedup, depth tracking via `user_data`) — fetching itself stays on
  our own SSRF-safe transport rather than Crawlee's HTTP client, since that
  client can't easily carry the DNS-pinning from phase 1
- `FetchStrategyRouter`: deterministic adaptive HTTP-vs-browser routing,
  biased by persisted per-domain success-rate stats (`fetch_strategy_stats`),
  with per-page escalation to the browser when the JS-dependency heuristic
  says a fetched page is a client-rendered shell
- MinIO raw-artifact storage, Trafilatura-based `GenericExtractor`, exact +
  normalized + SimHash-based dedup signals, document versioning (NEW /
  UPDATED / UNCHANGED classification)
- `POST/GET /api/v1/crawls`, `GET /api/v1/crawls/{id}`,
  `GET /api/v1/crawls/{id}/pages`, `POST /api/v1/crawls/{id}/cancel`,
  `GET /api/v1/documents`, `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}`,
  `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/versions`,
  `GET /api/v1/documents/{id}/diff?from_version=&to_version=`

### Phase 3 — Monitoring + Search

- `sources` (monitored URLs), created only from a valid, non-expired
  pre-flight report whose domain matches the source URL
- In-process scheduler (`services/scheduling/scheduler.py`): polls for
  sources with `next_crawl_at <= now`, dispatches a `crawl_type=monitoring`
  job through the *same* `run_crawl` pipeline instant crawl uses
- Adaptive re-crawl interval (deterministic, spec section 42): any real
  change snaps the interval back to `min_interval_seconds`; an unchanged
  crawl doubles it, capped at `max_interval_seconds` — pure function at
  `SourceRepository.compute_next_interval`, unit-tested without a database
- Efficient re-discovery for monitoring crawls: before dispatch, the
  scheduler fetches the source's sitemap/RSS (reusing phase 1's own
  bounded, sampled checks) and seeds the crawl with those URLs instead of
  relying on a homepage-only crawl every interval
- `MonitoringEvent`s (NEW/UPDATED/UNCHANGED/REMOVED) recorded per page per
  monitoring crawl; `REMOVED` requires `monitoring_removal_failure_threshold`
  *consecutive* failures for that specific URL (default 3) — a transport
  failure or a genuine 4xx/5xx response both count, a single blip does not
- `SearchRepository` abstraction (spec section 56) with a Postgres full-text
  implementation (`to_tsvector`/`plainto_tsquery`/`ts_rank` against
  `documents.current_content`) — `index_document`/`update_document`/
  `delete_document` are no-ops here (the row already *is* the index) but
  exist so an OpenSearch-backed implementation is a drop-in later
- `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/sources`,
  `POST /api/v1/sources/{id}/{start,pause,resume}`,
  `GET /api/v1/sources/{id}/events`, `GET /api/v1/sources/{id}/statistics`,
  `POST /api/v1/search`, `POST /api/v1/search/instant`

### Phase 4 — Observability + Hardening

- Prometheus metrics at `GET /metrics` (`prometheus-client`, standard text
  exposition format): crawl counts, page fetch/failure counts, HTTP-vs-
  browser split, bytes downloaded, extraction success/failure, documents
  created/updated, pre-flight run counts by status. Wired as `EventBus`
  subscribers (`app/core/metrics.py`) rather than sprinkled `.inc()` calls
  through the crawl engine — `CRAWL_COMPLETED`'s event payload already
  carries the full per-run stats dict, so one subscriber folds it into
  counters at crawl-completion granularity
- Structured-enough logging: every log line carries the active
  `request_id` (contextvar-based, propagates through async calls within a
  request; background tasks log `crawl_job_id`/`source_id` directly instead
  since they have no HTTP request)
- Full `docker compose up` verified from a clean build: image build
  (including `playwright install --with-deps chromium`), automatic Alembic
  migration on container start (0001→0004 in order), health check passing
  against the containerized Postgres, and a real preflight + crawl run
  producing a genuinely new document in a zero-prior-data database

## Architecture

```
API (FastAPI)
  |

  |
  +-- POST /crawls -> asyncio.create_task(run_crawl) -> 202 immediately
  |

          - add_event(NEW|UPDATED|UNCHANGED|REMOVED)
          - (at crawl end) mark_crawled_and_reschedule -> adaptive interval

PostgresSearchRepository  <-  POST /search, /search/instant
```

Every outbound fetch — HTTP or browser, pre-flight, instant crawl, or
monitoring crawl — goes through `URLSecurityService`. See phase 1's section
below for the DNS-pinning/redirect-revalidation details; nothing about that
changed in phases 2-3, every new fetch path (crawl pages, sitemap/feed
discovery) routes through the same `security.build_client()` /
`browser_fetch_page` primitives.

### Why no separate worker process yet

Section 58/89 of the spec calls for API / scheduler / crawler-worker /
browser-worker as separate services. Through phase 3 both crawls *and* the
monitoring scheduler run as `asyncio` tasks inside the API process —
deliberately. The durable state that matters (which sources are due, what
each crawl found) lives in Postgres either way; a `sources.next_crawl_at`
row survives an API restart even though the in-memory scheduler loop
doesn't, so a redeploy costs at most one late tick, not lost schedule state.
A worker split earns its complexity once a single process can't keep up
with concurrent long-running monitoring crawls — that's an operational
scaling decision, not a phase-3 correctness requirement. The seam is
already there: `run_crawl(job_id, seed_url, settings, extra_seed_urls=...)`
and `scheduler_loop(settings)` don't know or care whether they're called
from the API process or a dedicated worker pulling jobs off a queue.

## Setup

Requires Python 3.12+, an **existing external PostgreSQL** server with
[`docs/unified_schema.sql`](docs/unified_schema.sql) already applied, MinIO
(or any S3-compatible store), and (for browser fallback) Playwright Chromium.

**PostgreSQL is not started by Docker.** Compose only runs MinIO (+ optional
API). The app does **not** run Alembic or `create_all` at startup.

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev]" --python .venv/bin/python

# 2. Install Playwright's browser
.venv/bin/python -m playwright install chromium

# 3. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env — DATABASE_URL (external Postgres) and MINIO_* required
# optional: HF_TOKEN for GLiNER first download

# 4. Ensure schema exists on the external DB (manual; do this once)
# psql "$DATABASE_URL_SYNC" -f docs/unified_schema.sql
# (use a non-async URL form for psql, e.g. postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db)

# 5. Start MinIO (Terminal A) if not already running
docker compose up minio

# 6. Start the API (Terminal B) — also starts the in-process monitoring scheduler
.venv/bin/uvicorn bluweb_app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Or `docker compose up --build` for MinIO + API only (still uses `.env`
`DATABASE_URL` for external Postgres; never creates Postgres).

**Do not run** `alembic upgrade head` against the unified database — the
files under `migrations/versions/` describe the obsolete multi-table schema.

## Environment variables

See `.env.example`. Beyond phases 1-2's:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MONITORING_REMOVAL_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` | Consecutive failures before a monitored URL is marked `REMOVED` (default 3) |
| `SCHEDULER_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | How often the in-process scheduler checks for due sources (default 30) |

## API usage

**Pre-flight** and **instant crawl** — see phases 1-2 sections above,
unchanged.

**Create and activate a monitored source** (requires a fresh pre-flight):

```bash
PF=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/preflight \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url": "https://example-news-site.com"}')
PFID=$(echo "$PF" | python3 -c "import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin)['preflight_id'])")

SRC=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sources -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{
  \"name\": \"Example News\", \"url\": \"https://example-news-site.com\",
  \"preflight_id\": \"$PFID\", \"interval_seconds\": 900
}")
SRCID=$(echo "$SRC" | python3 -c "import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin)['source_id'])")

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sources/$SRCID/start
```

The scheduler picks it up on its next poll tick, runs a monitoring crawl
through the same engine as instant crawl, and reschedules adaptively.

**Watch what changed:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sources/$SRCID/events
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sources/$SRCID/statistics
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sources/$SRCID/pause
```

**Search collected content:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/search -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "election results", "domain": "example-news-site.com", "limit": 10}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/search/instant -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://some-site.com", "query": "keyword", "max_pages": 5, "wait_seconds": 8}'
```

**Health checks:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health         # liveness, no dependencies
curl http://localhost:8000/health/ready   # verifies Postgres connectivity
```

Full OpenAPI docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## Tests

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

52 tests: phase 1's 25 (SSRF blocking, HTML analysis, JS heuristic, mocked
pre-flight runs), phase 2's 13 (SimHash/exact/normalized dedup,
`FetchStrategyRouter` decisions), phase 3's 9 (adaptive re-crawl interval
math, search snippet extraction), phase 4's 5 (metrics counters fold event
payloads correctly, request-id logging filter).

These exercise logic directly and don't need Postgres/MinIO/network running.
The full live path was verified manually during development against real
Postgres, real MinIO, real network, and real Playwright — including:

- `https://example.com` and `https://books.toscrape.com` instant crawls:
  extraction, storage, versioning, link-bounded traversal, cancellation
- `https://quotes.toscrape.com` as a monitored source: preflight → source
  creation → activation → scheduler dispatch → 98 pages crawled and
  correctly attributed to the source → adaptive interval held at the floor
  (everything was new) → full-text search returning real ranked results
  with snippets
- REMOVED detection: 3 consecutive `record_source_url_failure` calls
  against the real DB correctly flip status to `removed` exactly once; a
  success in between resets the counter to 0 (no false removal from a blip)
- Re-crawling an already-seen URL: correctly classified `UNCHANGED`
- SSRF: crawl and source creation against a cloud-metadata address both
  rejected with `400` before any request is made

Bugs actually caught and fixed by this manual pass (not hypothetical) —
phase 3 alone: `Document.source_id`/`crawl_job_id` never got backfilled
when a monitoring crawl matched a document created by an earlier instant
crawl, breaking source-scoped queries; a feed URL was being enqueued as a
crawl seed instead of being parsed for its entry links (would have run the
article extractor against raw RSS/Atom XML); `to_tsvector` on
`title + current_content` returned NULL for any document with no title
(SQL NULL propagation) breaking search for those rows; a stale-identity-map
read in `/search/instant`'s polling loop, and the `MissingGreenlet` crash
that a naive `expire_all()` fix caused (SQLAlchemy's async ORM does the
resulting refresh outside the awaited call — fixed with `populate_existing`
instead); a 404/5xx response was being treated as fetch *success* for
`REMOVED`-detection purposes since the HTTP transaction itself succeeded.

Also verified in phase 4: full `docker compose up` from a clean image
build — automatic migration 0001→0004, health check against the
containerized DB, and a real crawl producing a genuinely new document in a
zero-prior-data database (not just "the container starts").

## Security considerations

- **SSRF**: see `app/services/security/url_security.py`. Validates scheme,
  resolves and checks every A/AAAA record, pins HTTP connections to the
  validated IP, re-validates on every redirect hop, every browser
  subresource request, and every crawl-discovered or feed-discovered link
  before it's fetched.
- **Known residual gap**: the browser-fallback path validates each request
  Playwright makes but does not pin Playwright's own TCP connection the way
  the httpx transport does — a sufficiently fast DNS-rebinding attacker could
  still race between our check and Chromium's connect. Would need a
  validating forward proxy in front of Chromium to close fully.
- Never disable `BLOCK_PRIVATE_NETWORKS` against untrusted input.

## Post-phase-4 upgrade: page classification + structured extraction

Built on top of the 4-phase system above without rewriting it (KEEP the
Crawlee frontier / SSRF layer / FetchStrategyRouter / dedup / scheduler /
REMOVED detection / MinIO / Postgres / Prometheus / EventBus; EXTEND
`fetch_strategy_stats` into a domain profile and `SearchRepository`'s
Postgres backend; ADOPT `extruct` for structured-data parsing; DEFER
Scrapling, embeddings/clustering, WARC, distributed workers, and
OpenSearch/Kafka/Temporal/K8s until there's evidence they're needed):

- **Page classifier** (`services/classification/page_classifier.py`):
  deterministic, URL-pattern + structured-data + OpenGraph + DOM signals,
  no ML — same "pluggable, model-ready interface, deterministic first"
  posture as `FetchStrategyRouter`. Classifies into NEWS_ARTICLE,
  BLOG_POST, FORUM_THREAD/INDEX, CLASSIFIED_LISTING/INDEX, CATEGORY,
  SEARCH_RESULTS, HOME, DOCUMENT, UNKNOWN.
- **Structured data extraction** (`services/extraction/structured_data.py`):
  JSON-LD/microdata/OpenGraph via `extruct` (BSD-licensed), feeding both
  the classifier and the article extractor from one parse per page.
- **News/Blog extractor** (`services/extraction/article_extractor.py`):
  layers structured data (headline/author/dates/publisher/section/tags/
  images) over Trafilatura's own extraction — one implementation for both
  page types, per the spec's own "reuse, don't duplicate" instruction.
  Live-verified against a real BBC News article: correct headline, author,
  publish date, all pulled from the page's actual JSON-LD.
- **DomainProfile**: extended `fetch_strategy_stats` (not a parallel table)
  with `avg_content_bytes` and a `failure_counts` JSONB bag, exposed at
  `GET /domains/{domain}/profile`.
- **Failure classification** (`services/crawling/failure_classification.py`):
  normalizes fetch outcomes (DNS/TLS/timeout/403/404/410/429/5xx/...) and
  fixes a real correctness gap from phase 3 — a 403/429 (blocked/
  throttled) no longer counts toward `REMOVED`, only genuine "it's gone"
  signals (404/410/DNS failure/repeated timeout/5xx) do. Live-verified
  against the real DB: 403s never trip removal no matter how many happen;
  404s trip it at exactly the configured threshold.
- **Postgres GIN search** (spec Phase Q): `documents.search_vector` is now
  a Postgres *stored generated column* (`to_tsvector` recomputed by the
  database itself on write) with a GIN index, replacing the old query-time
  `to_tsvector(...)` call — same `SearchRepository` interface, verified via
  `EXPLAIN` that the index is real and usable (a 1-row table correctly
  seq-scans instead; forcing `enable_seqscan=off` confirms the index plan).
- `documents.page_type` (indexed, filterable via `GET /documents?page_type=`)
  and `extraction_confidence`/`extraction_method` now exposed in the API.

**Deferred, with rationale** (per the spec's own KEEP/EXTEND/ADOPT/DEFER
model): Forum/Classified extractors need real fixtures to build against
responsibly (the spec itself says prefer stored fixtures for repeatability)
— none exist yet, and shipping untested guesses at forum HTML structure
would be worse than not shipping them. Scrapling, embeddings/clustering,
multilingual, WARC/replay, distributed workers, and auth/RBAC are all real
next priorities but are separable, substantial pieces of work in their own
right — flagging them rather than doing them shallowly.

## Known limitations (honest, per spec)

- No forum/classified-specific extraction yet (see "Deferred" above) — the
  generic/News/Blog extractors handle those page types via URL-pattern
  classification only, without preserving thread/listing structure.
- SimHash is computed and stored (`documents.simhash`) but nothing queries
  it yet for actual near-dup clustering across documents.
- Metrics are aggregated at crawl-completion granularity (folded from the
  `CRAWL_COMPLETED` event's stats dict), not per-page/per-request — no
  latency histogram exists yet since no per-request timing is threaded
  through events; add one if p95 dashboards are actually needed.
- robots.txt matching is root-path-only, not a full RFC 9309 matcher.
- The scheduler and crawls run in-process (see "Why no separate worker
  process yet" above) — fine at current scale, not yet suitable for many
  concurrent long-running monitoring crawls at production scale.
- No auth on the API — add before exposing beyond localhost/trusted network.
- No rate limiting / per-domain politeness delay beyond the concurrency cap
  (`DomainProfile.failure_counts` now tracks 429/403 rates, but nothing
  reads them back into throttling decisions yet).
- `SourceCreateRequest` requires an exact domain match against the
  pre-flight's URL; it does not re-verify the pre-flight's findings are
  still accurate at source-creation time beyond the TTL check.

## Scaling path

Single-process FastAPI + Postgres + MinIO today, with an in-process
scheduler. A dedicated worker/scheduler process, Redis for cross-process
coordination, OpenSearch, Kafka, and distributed workers all stay behind
clean interfaces (`SearchRepository`, the `EventBus` in
`app/services/events.py`, `run_crawl`'s job-id-in/nothing-out signature) so
they can be introduced later without changing the service layer.

## Phase 9: capability learning, discovery, and provenance

> The sections above (Status, Known limitations) predate Phases 5-9 and
> were not backfilled as part of this work -- treat this section as the

> the source of truth for anything not mentioned.

**Domain and URL-pattern capability learning.** `FetchStrategyStats` (one
row per domain) and `URLPatternStats` (one row per domain+URL-pattern+
page-type, e.g. `/news/{id}` on `example.com`) already tracked HTTP/browser
success rates from Phase 6; Phase 9 adds discovery status (`sitemap_status`,
`feed_status` -- one of `available`/`not_present`/`failed`/`blocked`/
`invalid`/`unknown`, see `DiscoveryStatus`), extraction quality
(`avg_extraction_quality`, a running average of `score_extraction().overall`,
not just success/fail), and `pagination_detected_count`. A capability only
influences routing once its `http_attempts + browser_attempts` clears
`domain_learning_min_observations` (default 5) -- see
`decide_routing`/`compute_health_score` in
`app/services/crawling/domain_profile_service.py`.

**Decision precedence** (unchanged from Phase 6, now exposed as
`RoutingDecision.basis`): explicit request > URL-pattern history > domain
history > JS-dependency heuristic > HTTP default. Each `RoutingDecision`
carries `reasons` (human-readable) and `basis` (`"explicit"`/`"url_pattern"`/
`"domain"`/`"js_heuristic"`/`"default"`) so a decision is always explainable
and machine-filterable.

**Feedback loop**: `crawl_engine.py::_process_page` calls
`CrawlRepository.record_fetch_outcome`/`record_pattern_outcome` after every
page (now including `extraction_quality` and `pagination_detected`), and
calls `decide_routing` (via `domain_profile_service`) *before* every fetch,
reading back the same rows. A domain/pattern's next crawl genuinely uses
what the previous one learned -- see `tests/test_domain_profile_service.py`
for the decision-layer proof (first observation -> default, sufficient
observations -> learned strategy, repeated failures -> browser escalation,
insufficient evidence -> no influence). The write side (the repository
methods themselves) reuses the same `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` +
`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` + `populate_existing=True` locking pattern already
live-verified under concurrency in Phase 6/7 -- see "Known limitations"
below for why that reuse wasn't independently re-verified live in this
phase.

**Discovery**: `app/services/discovery/sitemap_discovery.py` recurses a
sitemap *index* into real content-page URLs (bounded: depth ≤ 2, ≤10 nested
sitemaps, ≤500 URLs/sitemap, ≤2000 total) -- fixes a real bug where nested
sitemap FILE urls were previously enqueued as if they were articles.
`app/services/discovery/pagination.py` detects `rel=next` / link-text /
numbered pagination and enqueues the next page at the *same* crawl depth
(a "next page" is more of the same listing, not a deeper link).
`seed_discovery.py::discover_extra_seeds` now feeds both instant crawls
(`POST /crawls`) and monitored recrawls (the scheduler) identically, and
persists `sitemap_status`/`feed_status` onto the domain's capability row via
`persist_discovery_outcome`.

**Extraction provenance**: `app/services/extraction/provenance.py::
build_provenance` records, per extracted field (title/author/body/price),
`{value, source, extractor, confidence}` -- `source` is one of `json_ld`/
`schema_org`/`dom`/`trafilatura`/`scrapling`/`unknown`, derived from which
extractor actually produced the value (e.g. compares the final headline
against what structured data would have given, rather than guessing).
Stored under `extracted_metadata["provenance"]` (the existing JSONB column
on `Document` -- no migration, no new consumer breakage). `body`'s `value`
is a 200-char snippet, not the full text, to avoid duplicating
`Document.current_content`.

**Capabilities API**: `GET /domains/{domain}/capabilities` returns
interpreted intelligence (discovery status, fetch success rates, page-type
extraction success/quality, a routing recommendation with `reasons`+
`basis`) built from the same rows `GET /domains/{domain}/profile` reads --
distinguishes `"insufficient_data"` from a real `"low"`/`"medium"`/`"high"`
confidence rather than treating "never observed" and "actually good" the
same way.

**Known limitations (Phase 9, superseded by Final Engineering Report above)**:
- Many items listed historically here were closed in the final completion
  pass (HN `/news` → `NEWS_INDEX`, multi-signal JS detection, grouped table
  headers, learning feedback for quality/browser-compare). See §36–38.
- Remaining honest gaps: no Postgres integration-test fixture; browser
  DNS-pin residual; migrations must be applied by operators; live Docker
  verification was not run in the final pass (host services prohibited).
